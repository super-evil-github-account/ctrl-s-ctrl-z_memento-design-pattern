# ctrl-s-ctrl-z_memento-design-pattern
Practice your Implementation of the Memento Design Pattern!

In this exercise you will practice the memento design pattern

Classes:

Originator:

	An object where changes takes place. for example -> text editor
	Changes made in the originator that user wants to save - class provides the 'createMemento' method that functions as a SAVE     
	
Memento:

	An object that stores the originator state
	createMemento creates a Memento object that is the current state of the Originator and is stored inside Caretaker list.
	
CareTaker:

		Stores all states
		restore - pops back the last Memento object saved (UNDO)
	
	
Step 1:
------
Memento class:

	private final String content;

implement the following methods:

	Memento(String content); 
	=> constructor that takes content and sets it

	String getContent(); 
	=> getter method for content

	String toString();
	=> create a toString method

Step 2:
-------
TextEditor class: (Originator)
		
	private String content;

implement the following methods:

	void setContent(String content); 
	=> setter for content

	String toString();
	=> create a toString method

	Memento createMemento(); 
	=> create a new memento (snapshot of this current state of the originator)

	void restore(Memento memento); 
	=> recieve a memento from the Caretaker and re-set the state of your content.


Step 3:
-------
HistoryLog class: (CareTaker)

	private List<Memento> states;

implement the folloing methods:

	HistoryLog(); 
	=> constructor (instantiate the List with your favorite List util implementation. 
	I suggest for this task, simply use ArrayList, 
	but take notice that in more complicated applications
	you might need another implementation, and perhaps even another type of Collection)

	void push(Memento state);
	=> recieve a state and store it in the collection.

	Memento pop(); 
	=> fetch the element beforre the last one of the collection, remove it from the list and return it.

	void printLogs():
	=> print all the logs saved in your list


Step 4:
-------
Test class:

	Create a Test class with main method to test your memento pattern!
	In the test please follow these instructions:

	- Create an instance of the TextEditor and set your String content.
	- Create an instance of HistoryLog
	- Use HistoryLogâ€™s push method that takes a memento created by the TextEditorâ€™s createMemento method: => HistoryLog.push(TextEditor.createMemento());
	- Create multiple pushes to the HistoryLog. This will reset the content in your TextEditor each time, but will fill the history of edits.
	- Use TextEditorâ€™s restore that takes HistoryLogâ€™s pop - to restore to last saved state. => TextEditor.restore(HistoryLog.pop())
